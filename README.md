# Twister-Blog-Android

This project was made during Yandex Development Automatization School 2014/2015.
Actually, it's just the GUI to web-blog made by our project group - https://github.com/autoschool/twister.
It contains unit-tests (JUnit 4.10) and system-tests (Espresso 2.0) examples for Android, and gradle build settings as well.

How to run tests:
"gradle connectedAndroidTest" - simple way
"gradle spoon" - let us specify devices to run, tests size and so on (https://github.com/stanfy/spoon-gradle-plugin for more datails)
